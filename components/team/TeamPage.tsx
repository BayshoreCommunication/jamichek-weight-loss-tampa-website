    name: `Dr. Emily Devol Webster`,
    designation: "Medical Director",
    details: `Dr. Emily Devol Webster always knew she wanted to help people and began manifesting her career as a physician from the age of 14. She attended Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2011, followed by Rowan University for residency training, to pursue her dreams. The morning of her medical school graduation, Emily received a phone call that would change her life forever- she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three days later Emily had a bilateral mastectomy- a procedure where both breasts are removed at the same time. She wrestled through 9 surgeries, dozens of treatments, multiple reconstructions, and a handful of complications while undertaking residency. While undergoing cancer treatment as a medical resident, Dr. Devol Webster even testified before the New Jersey State Assembly, leading to instrumental expansion of the New Jersey State paid family and disability laws.  Through her own personal experiences as a patient, Dr. Devol Webster realized her true passion. Since then, she has dedicated her life to helping men and women achieve their wellness and aesthetic goals through the art and science of modern medicine. Through years of training and practice she has been appointed a National Speaker and KOL for top aesthetic companies, her office has been named as a Center of Excellence training facility, she has been awarded Tampa Top Doc in Cosmetic Surgery 4 years in a row, and has continued to train internationally with top medical providers in the body sculpting and aesthetic field. She uses her experience to empower and teach others to live their life to the fullest. Today, Emily is married to a loving and supportive husband, and has a beautiful 5-year-old daughter that's just as sweet, lively, and captivating as her mommy. Dr. Devol Webster is passionate about continuing education, so that she may provide the most innovative and cutting edge technologies in the field of cosmetic body sculpting, aesthetic medicine, and bio-hacking. In the words of Dr. Devol Webster, "wellness has completely transformed my life and I want to share my experience and expertise with others because I believe we all deserve to not only look, but feel our best." `,
